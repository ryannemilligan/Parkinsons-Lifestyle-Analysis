# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Dashboard Project (Tableau Focus)

## Overview
This project was developed to demonstrate **proficiency in Tableau** by analyzing a Parkinson’s Disease dataset. While Python was used for data cleaning and preparation, the main emphasis is on building an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to visualize clinical and demographic patterns between diagnosed individuals and healthy controls.

---

## Objectives

- Showcase **Tableau skills** using synthetic health data based on real-world cases. 
- Highlight data storytelling through interactive visuals
- Support analysis with basic Python preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Visualizations in Tableau

- 📊 **Diagnosis Breakdown**: Visual distribution of Parkinson’s vs. Healthy individuals  
- 🌀 **Tremor Presence by Diagnosis**: Comparing average tremor values  
- 📦 **UPDRS Score Distribution**: Box plots to compare symptom severity  
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Demographics**: Age and gender insights across diagnosis groups

📍 **Note**: All visuals are built in Tableau Public and designed for user interaction.
